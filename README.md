# Grocery List

Introducing the Grocery List App, the ultimate solution for organizing your shopping needs! This app allows you to create and manage your grocery list easily and efficiently.

With the Grocery List App, you can add items to your list with just a few taps on your device. You can also delete items from the list, making it easy to manage and update your shopping needs.

The app features two checkmarks for each item, allowing you to move the item to a separate "checked" list after you've picked it up at the store. This feature keeps your list organized and helps you keep track of what you still need to purchase.

Additionally, there is a handy button that can move all checked items back to the regular list. This feature is perfect for when you want to start a new shopping trip without having to manually move each item back to the main list.
